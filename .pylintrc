# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
# give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,). You can also use
# "--disable=all" to disable everything first and then reenable specific checks.
# For example, if you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use
# "--disable=all --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes
# checker, but have no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all
# --enable=classes --disable=W".
