Welcome to Cryptle
==================

Welcome to Cryptle's documentation. Cryptle is a Python algorithmic trading
framework. Get started with backtesting at :doc:`quickstart`, or go straight to
:doc:`livetrade`. Once you are familiar with the basic concepts, we recommend
you to proceed to the :doc:`User guides <guides>`, where there would be detailed
information about individual components in Cryptle.

Those who are familiar with the framework can head over to :doc:`advanced` to
find specific task-oriented HOWTO recipes and explanation for core concepts used
throughout the framework.
